The different service models are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). The
three service models are briefly explained in the following.
\begin{description}

\item[IaaS] We are provided with the necessary
infrastructure to run a virtual machine and the rest is up to us.

\item[PaaS] We get the necessary resource as well as an OS
installed with some basic software. We can use the provided platform
and modify it as we please. However we are not able to touch the
underlying virtual hardware.

\item[SaaS] We are provided with everything needed to run a
specific software. We are only able to access the software and none of
its underlying components, like the OS or the hardware.
