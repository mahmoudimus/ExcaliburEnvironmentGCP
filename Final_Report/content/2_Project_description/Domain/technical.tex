Virtualization allows us to move from physical mediums to virtual ones
without really losing anything. The only major difference is that now
we do not manipulate the hardware directly but instead manipulate the
virtual hardware through specific software. This allows for great
flexibility in a lot of ways.

Cloud computing brings the domain of virtualization to yet another
level. We are still manipulating a virtual medium, but the virtual
machine does not run locally on our physical machines. Instead these
machines run on some servers and we can controll them through a remote
connection. This leads us to the various service models employed by
the cloud.
