We have to consider two types of users: the DevOps engineer and the
Excalibur user.

As for the DevOps engineer, the objective of this BSP is to have a
fully automated solution that handles the virtual machine creation on
the Google Cloud Platform.  Added to this, all the necessary tools
should be downloaded such that we can put an Excalibur Environment on
it. He also needs to ensure access to the new virtual machine for the
Excalibur user.

As for the Excalibur user, we want him to simply be able to connect to
the virtual machine created in the cloud and use the Excalibur
Environment. The end user should not worry about anything related to
the virtual machine's creation and setup.
