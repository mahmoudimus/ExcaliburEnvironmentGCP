Firstly, we had to get familiar with GCP since this is the tool we
used to create our virtual machines\footnote{On GCP they are referred
to as \textit{instances}}. This means that we had to learn and
understand how to work with the platform.

While trying to achieve the provisioning on the instances, we
encountered a problem that required us to familiarise with private and
public key pairs to get remote access to GCP instances.

Lastly we want to create a tutorial that accompanies our technical
solution.  The tutorial is meant to guide the DevOps engineer and help
him understand and use our solution.
