Due to time constraints, we are not going to use the Excalibur
Tutorial as our test case. Instead, we will do a few basic tasks to
check if the machine is usable.

We are going to download and install Remarkable for this purpose.
Since downloading and installing software will be part of the tasks
required to set up Excalibur, this seems like a good trade off.

Further, to make this test case more adapted to a real lift situation,
we will be running one or two Youtube videos in the background as well
as having a word editor opened while doing the installation.

We will also evaluate the solution with regards to the non-functional
requirements to check how well these have been tackled.
