The main techical deliverable for this BSP, is a solution that
automates the process of creating and provisioning virtual machines on
the Google Cloud Platform in order to host an Excalibur Environment on
it. Part of this solution is based on earlier results that have been
worked out in the previous semester. 

The functional requirement of this solution is to set up a new
Excalibur Environment as fast as possible while needing the least
amount of effort. We want as much of the set up as possible to be done
by simply executing the provided scripts.

The non-functional requirements are more numerous. We want to tackle:
\begin{enumerate}

	\item \textbf{Operability}, which determines how accessible and
		easy to use the solution is.

	\item \textbf{Efficiency}, which considers the amount of effort
		necessary to bring the solution to use.
		
	\item \textbf{Satisfaction}, informs us on the degree to which user needs
		are satisfied when a product or system is used in a specified
		context of use.
		
	
	\item \textbf{Maintainability}, considers the ease at which the developer
		can change aspects of the Virtual Machine creation and the provisioning.
		
	\item \textbf{Reliability}, tells us whether or not our solution
		is reliable. In other words: Does it give the same result in
		successive trials?
		
\end{enumerate}

This technical deliverable is targeted towards a DevOps engineer, who
is in charge of setting up these machines. The Excalibur user should
not have to deal with anything regarding the production of the final
product, namely the Excalibur Environment.
