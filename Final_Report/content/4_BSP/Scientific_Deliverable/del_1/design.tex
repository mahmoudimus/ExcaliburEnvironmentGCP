In order to learn about GCP and understand how it works, we decided to
look for online courses and tutorials. These courses were meant to
teach us the basic usage of the platform as well as a few basic
concepts related to it. 

The first
tutorial\footnote{\url{https://bics.udemy.com/introduction-to-cloud-computing/learn/v4/overview}}
we watched was a single long video that briefly explained all the
concepts related to GCP, thus giving a first overview of what we will
be dealing with.

After that, we watched two tutorial series, although not in their
entirety, created by Google
themselves\footnote{\url{https://www.coursera.org/learn/gcp-fundamentals/home/welcome}
and
\url{https://www.coursera.org/learn/gcp-infrastructure-foundation/home/welcome}}
that gave a more detailed insight into the various concepts and how
they work in practice through a set of exercises.

Finally, when first accessing GCP a message popped up proposing a
guided tour through the platform. This was basically an interactive
tutorial that showed us how to navigate the platform and where to find
the most important tools.
