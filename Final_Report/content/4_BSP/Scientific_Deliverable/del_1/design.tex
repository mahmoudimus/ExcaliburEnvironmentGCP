In order to learn about GCP and understand how it works, we decided to
look for online courses and tutorials. These courses were meant to
teach us the basic usage of the platform as well as a few basic
concepts related to it. 

The first tutorial\cite{udemy-tutorial} we watched was a single long
video that briefly explained all the concepts related to cloud
computing, thus giving a first overview of what we will be dealing
with.

After that, we watched two tutorial
series\cite{coursera-fundamentals}\cite{coursera-infrastructure},
although not in their entirety, created by Google themselves that gave
a more detailed insight into the various concepts and how they work in
practice through a set of exercises.

Finally, when first accessing GCP a message popped up proposing a
guided tour through the platform. This was basically an interactive
tutorial that showed us how to navigate the platform and where to find
the most important tools.
