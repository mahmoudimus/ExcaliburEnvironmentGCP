Describe here all the properties that characterize the deliverables
you produced. It should describe, for each main deliverable, what are
the expected functional and non functional properties of the
deliverables, who are the actors exploiting the deliverables. It is
expected that you have at least one scientific deliverable (e.g.
``Scientific presentation of the Python programming language'',
``State of the art on quality models for human computer interaction'',
\ldots.) and one technical deliverable (e.g. ``BSProSoft - A
python/django web-site for IT job offers retrieval and analysis'',
\ldots).
