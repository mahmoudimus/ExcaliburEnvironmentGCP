To learn how to get SSH access to GCP instances we had to options
which we both exploited and combined.

The first option we had at our disposal were the guidelines provided
by GCP. The platform provides a lot of documentation on a lot of
topics and we managed to find soem help about \textit{Connecting to
instances}. It explained various ways to connect to various types of
machines. However, for our purpose of provisioning SSH connections
seemed like the way to go. Considering that we have a project, we were
able to set up an SSH connection that applies to all the instances.
That way we did not need to ensure access for each instances
individually.
