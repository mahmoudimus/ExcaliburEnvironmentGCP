To learn how to get SSH access to GCP instances we had two options
which we both exploited and combined.

The first option we had at our disposal were the guidelines provided
by GCP. The platform provides a lot of documentation on a lot of
topics and we managed to find some help about \textit{Connecting to
instances}\cite{GCP-connect}. It explained various ways to connect to
various types of machines. However, for our purpose of provisioning
SSH connections seemed like the way to go.

To further deepen our understanding on how to manage SSH access we
also read blogs\cite{ssh-tutorial-2}\cite{ssh-tutorial-3} and
tutorials\cite{ssh-tutorial-1} that were rather unrelated to GCP.
Since SSH is not a specific feature of GCP we were, in the end, able
to apply what we have learnt.
