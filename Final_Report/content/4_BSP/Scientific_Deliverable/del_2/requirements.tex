After having accomplished the creation of instances on GCP, we wanted
to provision these instances using Ansible and the work we have done
in the previous semester. We quickly encountered an issue where the
Ansible script was not able to connect to the machine and perform the
provisioning. As a result we needed to find out how to access GCP
instances remotely via SSH.
