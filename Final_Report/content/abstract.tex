This BSP is essentially a continuation on the last BSP which tackled
the issue of easing the creation of new environments. While last
semester we worked locally on our machines, meaning that we created
these environments on our pyhsical machine, this semester we work in
the cloud, so the environments will be hosted on a remote server which
we can access. Thus we are taking advantage of cloud computing.

We are reusing part of the work that has already been done, mainly the
scripts for provisioning and the assessment, and will expand upon it
to fit the wider scale and diffrent nature of this project.
