Virtual machines constitute the big scientific aspect to be familiar
with for this BSP. They were already briefly explained before in
section \ref{subsec:domain}.

Also the concept of provisioning should not be foreign. In essence,
provisioning allows us to put files and packages as well as execute
scripts onto a virtual machine without accessing it directly. We can
write scripts, or in our case configuration files, that will then
access the machine and accomplish all the specified tasks.
