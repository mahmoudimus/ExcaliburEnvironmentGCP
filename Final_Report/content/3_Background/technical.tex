The technical aspect to be familiar with for this BSP were how
provisioning works with Ansible. This is important because we are
trying to reuse the work done in the previous BSP and get it to work
on our virtual machines in the cloud.

Ansible is a tool that allows to write configuration files that
basically specify what a machine should be provisioned with. It allows
for great flexibility and keeps the focus on easy to read and write
code.
